<p style="text-align:left; font-family:arial;">Hi, I'm Stephen and I was born in South Africa with my family, although I lived there for 8ish years, I view myself 
as an Australian and follow Australian culture. I recently just finished high school at Brentwood SC, achieving a year
 12 passing grade. English is my main language, and while I think it's amazing to be able to speak multiple languages 
 fluently, the best I can do is speak some basic German and understand some bits of conversation. Something that people
 might find interesting about me is my ability, or complete lack thereof to find my way around, I have almost no sense 
 of direction. One time I was at a friend's place and decided to walk home from an area I've never been to... without my
 phone, and long story short I walked 15 km in the wrong direction before I realized that I might be heading in the wrong
 direction when I realized that the Dandenong mountains looked awfully closely.Hi, I'm Stephen and I was born in South Africa

<h3 style="text-align:center; font-family:arial; background-color:#e0c68b;">Interest in Information Technology</h3>
<h4 style="font-family:arial;">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular
event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">Although IT is a very broad and has cemented itself into almost every aspect of our daily lives, I have found a great interest in its 
raw implementation and rise in our society, pertaining to the coding and software that we don’t see. This interest was brought about by 
my dad and his co-workers at Weltraum, who showed me all aspects of how they operated both the hardware and software aspects of the company.
 This in turn led me to spend my work experience at their company, and gain a greater insight, and superficial understanding of the coding 
 of the applications which they created and used on a daily basis. This insight I had received 3 years ago allowed me to find my passion in
 the IT industry, especially in the software/ coding aspects, and since then I have chosen IT as a subject in every year leading up to year
 12 which they provided soft dev as an option. </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">I hadn't initially thought about going to RMIT when I first chose my UNI preferences, but as time went by and my anxiety rose due to the 
wait in offers, I decided to look into other UNI’s in my area and if my results were good enough to enter a course, of which RMIT was one of
 them. But before I applied I talked to my Couse councilor at school and told him what I had wanted to do as a career, and he recommended RMIT
 as choice, and in his own words, “RMIT is one of if not the best University when It comes to information technology and information systems,
 with facilities that could take you to the outcome you want.” from then on I never looked back and applied ASAP through Open Universities Australia.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">Before I began this course, I expected the course to act as a general introduction to almost all areas of IT, ranging from automation and coding
 to hardware. However, from what I've seen during this past two weeks of this course, this course focus not only on the individual but also the team
 aspect of a business, and how we can apply ourselves in the creation of a desirable outcome/ goal. I’ve come to expect that while this course aims
 to explore the different areas of IT, it primarily uses IT to focus on the idea of groups and combined effort in the prospects of a working environment.</p>


<h3 style="text-align:center; font-family:arial; background-color:#e0c68b;" >Ideal Job</h3>
<a  href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41182784?type=standout#searchRequestToken=c664dacd-f57c-4a8a-8d8f-49b3028a3d4e " >Ideal Job - Seek Link</a>
<h4 style="font-family:arial;">what makes this position appealing to you?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">This software developer job opportunity in my eyes is an ideal job choice for me, not only in the sense that the job revolves around producing, testing
 and implementing software solutions to both clients and the company itself. But it allows for creative freedom and direction in how the solution is created,
 meaning that the jobs that I may have to undertake when I eventually reach this kind of goal won't become tedious and uninteresting, as it will force me 
 to practice and learn multiple languages. Another appealing factor to this job application is the idea that although the company wishes to provide its 	
 services to the clients at a high standard, they are also very employee happiness orientated, providing free skill development training, fruit/food, and even
 a Friday off in which the team can just relax and have a coffee.  </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">What are the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">While being able to have the opportunity to work in an industry like this would be amazing, there are certain skill requirements and experience needed to be
 able to successfully part-take. Some of the skills that would be required would be enough coding experience to be able to understand .NET framework, and 
 successfully code in .NET. This particular job also requires as a minimum that the person endeavoring to take up this position have a fairly knowledgeable
 understanding of cloud computing on AWS (Amazon Web Services), and it also requires an understanding and ability to code modern Java  script, HTML and know, or
 at least have some understanding of Angular. Although the requirements may take a long time to meet and become versed in the expectations the job description 
 requires, these are all things that in the long run I'll be capable of. </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">What skills, qualifications and experience do you currently have?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">While I don’t have the best current knowledge due to only having finished year 12 last year. I have always (since it became an option) taken IT as a course,
 because as I had said earlier, became very interested in it since my dad and his workplace introduced it to me. However, the skills that I did obtain from that
 was an understanding of common principals such as the APP’s, an understanding of visual basics which may assist me in the upcoming assignment and future prospects,
 and a variety or other lessons that may or may not pass over to a working environment, due to its entry level introduction. </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">How you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">Well, this kind of job is very software focused, and requires a lot of experience in the creation of solutions in multiple languages. As far as the steps needed
 to take on a position such as this, I am currently learning java script alongside this subject and hope to gain a raw understanding of the code and how to properly
 implement it within a working environment. The other types of coding mentioned in the job description I aim to learn through a VTC (Virtual Training Company) which
 is a great online learning tool which provides tutorials and courses for multiple languages, and is commonly provided by employers to staff for training. I believe
 that this would be the best way to reach the standards of a position like this, as while it requires the knowledge of multiple languages and frameworks, they all 
 share common setups, which I have a slight understanding of through the work experience I undertook and the IT subjects I took from year 9-12. </p>


<h3 style="text-align:center; font-family:arial; background-color:#e0c68b;">Personal Profile</h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center; font-family:arial; background-color:#8083c9">Online Learning Styles Test : Visual Learner</h3>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">This results to me mean that I need to focus more on the visual aspect of my learning, and that to preform to the best of my ability I should concentrate on removing
 myself from visual distractions and attempt to make the information I retain and take in to be visually different and appealing as to remember it more effectively. 
 Also, while looking back now it makes sense that im a visual learner, it took me by surprise initially to find out that I am a visual learner, and all the greatest marks
 I achieved came from the application of visual cues rather than that of physical or auditory learning. </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">While my personal learning style and the way I communicate may not be all that affected, I may still attempt to employ some of the strategies that the site determined
 may be beneficial for a more effective learning time, such as the employment of more visual interpretations of information that I  might be communicating with the team,
 or even attempt to re-create the info provided by other team members  in a more visual way to allow  greater understanding and chance to remember that information in future. </p>

<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">I personally feel as though all individuals regardless of their working/learning styles can bring something to the team, and that’s why teams are created, in order to 
produce an outcome of a greater standard to that of an individual's efforts. I personally don’t think its someone's learning style that inhibits great team work, rather 
the willingness of the individuals to work and act within and beyond the expectation of not only themselves but others.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; font-family:arial; background-color:#8083c9;">16 Pesonalities Test : Mediator INFP-T</h3>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">These results dictate to me that I may need to be more assertive and less hung up on things that may plague me, such as what others think about me, my ideas or even my
 creations. But other than that, these results suggest that I'm really compatible person willing to listen to the perspective of others in a variety of settings, especially
 within a working environment. Also in regards to a team activity such as the assignment 2 coming up I feel that the results suggest that small group of 4-6 people would be
 to my benefit as meditators often work well in smaller groups.  </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">I personally don’t feel as If the results will change the way I approach my team and the tasks that may be set to me. However, like I stated in the previous question to
 this result, I may attempt to try and assert myself more and push more of my ideas rather than sit back and just do the work assigned by others within my group. </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">From these results I believe that it would be best to find people who are assertive and willing to lead the development of the project, but also have the ability to explain
 the tasks in great depth, as I think that this would push me to produce the greatest work. However, while I believe it would be important to find someone who is assertive 
 and well-spoken, I ultimately believe that any person regardless of their test results find success in working together as long as they have a good work ethic. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; font-family:arial; background-color:#8083c9">Psychometrics Test (Workplace Suitability) : Suitability 6-7 / 10  </h3>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">In my opinion, the results I achieved are not what I expected but completely understandable, in the ways that I responded to the questions looking back. These results suggest
 to me that I need to be more focused and confident in the ways that I approach and deliver in my aspirations, and be more self-confident in the way I hold myself to outperform
 those around me. Also, that I should (more than I currently do, 6/10) be or focus more on goal setting, in order to drive myself through achievement in breaking the goals that
 I have set, or others have set for me. </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">I think that these results may influence me the most out of all the personality tests conducted, as this directly correlates to how you may be expected to preform within a 
working/ group environment. In response to these results (7/10 in confidence in ability) ill attempt to undertake more of a prominent role in the production of a solution, being
 more confident in my ability to perform at a great capacity to those around me. Moreover, ill attempt to not only produce to minimum expected, but attempt to produce an outcome
 that would exceed the expectation of the other group members, hopefully eliciting a similar response from them. </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">While these results may affect the ways, I approach my tasks and the way I hold confidence in my ability to perform, I do not believe that these results are indicative of the
 type of people I may surround myself with in the creation of a team. As a group's ability to perform well relies on ALL the individuals of a group rising to the occasion and 
 exceeding the ability of an individual. </p>


<h3 style="text-align:center; font-family:arial; background-color:#e0c68b;">Project Idea : Performance Tracking Glasses</h3>
<h4 style="font-family:arial;">Overview</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">While there are precarious amounts of fitness and performance tracking apps for phones and smart watches, all these require the individual to stop what they're doing and
 monitor their performance. This can be detrimental to people who compete, or practice endurance training such as running and cycling. So, I believe that there should be an
 alternative that not only allows these individuals the capability to track their performance in real time, but view their current performance in contrast to those around 
 them and they’re own previous records. I call this project HUDFitness, which involves the planning and creation of a set of digital glasses that connect to you phone or 
 smart watch, displaying the info that the individual may find useful during their session, informing the user in real time of things such as their pace, performance and 
 heart rate just name a few. </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">Motivation</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">This project idea, although cliché in this current market offers originality in the sense that it has the ability to act as a performance assistant in Realtime, 
providing insight to the estimated 48 million cyclist and 47 million runners in the US alone. These HUDFitness glasses would also require minimal pre-existing tools for
 function as it would rely on Bluetooth connectivity to basic items that people carry on them such as phones or even smart watches. My personal motivation for its eventual
 creation is due my wish that I can view and monitor my own welfare whilst working out in Realtime, providing me insight into the little details such as if I'm pushing 
 too hard or not enough and if I'm acting within my optimum range.   </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">Description</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">These HUDFitness glasses will serve a variety of hardware and software functions ranging from tracking individual stats to displaying the next track on a playlist within
 the digital display of the glasses. The HUD will also allow users to access ALL the apps that they normally would on their phone or smart watch through its Bluetooth 
 connectivity, meaning that the user can still rely on their phone or smartwatch to plan a route or goal distance prior to starting, and rely on the glasses to display
 something such as maps or even the  estimated time to reach the goal based on previous runs. The glasses would also be made to have the ability to output two different displays
 across the 2 lenses, allowing the user to further personalize the way they monitor their performance, for example, showing their heartrate and speed on one lens and the map
 with distance if they so desire to on the other. Similarly, to other fitness tracking apps like STRAVA (very good app that works on phone) the glasses would be accompanied
 by an app that can be installed alongside the purchase of the glasses. This app would act as a personal data bank to everything the user may want to track, such as performance
 and speed along a section of track over a few months, or even record the average speed the user managed to produce during their chosen endurance activity. To further bolster
 the glasses originality, I would aim to implement a Bluetooth speaker/earphone system that can connect the individuals music, allowing them to listen to music and track their
 performance all in one connection, rather than deciding what would be more important for the cycle/run(Bluetooth can only have one device connect at a single time). Moreover,
 the brightness and intensity of the display is fully up to the user, meaning that the opacity of the display can be adjusted to the user's eyes, and the time of day. As a side
function, the glasses will not only display the UI set by the user but it will also protect the users eyes from the elements and they complete their physical activities. </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">Tools and Technology</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">While I ascertain that a  product such as this doesn’t require much in terms of hardware tech to work functionally, I do believe that a project such as this would require
 intensive programming and networking to not only produce the outputs on the screens, but also allow the user to interface with the display of specific app and icons on the
 screens. However, I do feel as if though an amazing open source tool that would be able to assist me in the creation of a product such as this would be Trello. As it allows
 a user to create, moderate, and organize the completion of milestones and goals. </p>

<h4 style="font-family:arial;">Skills Required</h4>
<ul>
  <li style="font-family:arial;">Prerequisite Knowledge</li>
</ul>  
  <p style="font-family:arial;">To produce the code to a functional level, I’ll need to have a knowledgeable understanding of java programming (for android) and swift for IOS if I wish to create the 
  application which stores the user's information regarding their activity, records and times. </p>

<ul>
  <li style="font-family:arial;">Software Requirements/ Needs</li>
</ul>
  <p style="font-family:arial;">Access to Objective-C and java programming launchers, such as eclipse for java and swift for coding in Android and IOS respectively. </p>

<ul>
  <li style="font-family:arial;">Required Hardware</li>
</ul>  
  <p style="font-family:arial;">Not much hardware is needed besides a frame for the glasses, wireless earphone tech and UI display glass for the front, which should be relatively straight forward to
  find or purchase. However, time would be needed to solve how the HUDFitness glasses will be assembled and time will be needed for the actual assembly of the product.</p>


<h4 style="font-family:arial;">Outcome</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;">If the project were to be successful, this item could be marketed to everyone who practices endurance fitness, regardless if they are just cycling for fun, or even 
attempting to prepare for an upcoming event. And while the problem isn't much more than a minor inconvenience, it still allows the user to adapt their pace and
 performance in real time to break barriers and records, with having to stop midway, or ponder the whole time, seeing only if you managed the goal at the end. 	if something
 like this were to take of successfully, this product could be updated to take into account weather and conditions, and measure everything without the requirement of pairing
 the HUDFitness glasses with a phone or smart device. </p>
